# Customer Segmentation & Targeting for a Grocery's Chips Category  
  

## 👋 Welcome!  
Welcome to my **Customer Segmentation & Targeting** project.  
This end-to-end data analytics case study explores customer behavior, product performance, and transaction patterns for a grocery store.  

The dataset contains messy data across purchase behaviour and transactions.  
As the data analyst, my goal is to clean, model, and analyze this data to help the Chips Category manager make informed decisions about customers segments and who she should be targeting within her category.
